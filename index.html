        <p class="intro_big"> The Race Is Over!</p>
        <!-- <p class="intro">
            Your marbles just finished a quick and dirty Stage 3. I would like to remind you that this stage had a
            disadvantage for marble weight. The quick turns and numerous obstacles of this stage made lighter marble
            seem to perform better. But again, gravity is a formidable adversary.</p>
        <p class="intro"> After a fairly mediocre performance on the first two stages, Built-like-a-plank Barbs Rogers
            walked away with the number 1 spot for stage 3. She would like to thank her sponsors: The Bird/Hillmans,
            Artemis: The moon goddess, and Tate's Cookies. In a post race interview, Barbs “invoked the fifth amendment”
            47 times.</p>
        <p class="intro">
            Rory Walsh finished second for the day. He had a particularly heated match up with Barbs and finished only
            .289 seconds behind. She attributes today's performance to her beanstalk like build and her team's
            data-driven approach. The matchup has #PlankvsBeanstalk trending on Twitter.</p>
        <p class="intro">
            Daniel Stewart finished up strongly in the last place spot for today. We listened in on the mid race
            commentary and Daniel seemed much more concerned with “these damn kids and their skateboards and their
            SnapTok...” than the race.</p> -->
        <!-- stage 4 -->
        <p class="intro">
            This is it, folks. You came, you rolled, you conquered. The marble race has officially come to an end. Stage
            5 was a mess, let me tell you.</p>
        <p class="intro"> Stage 5 gave advantage to deformed marbles. While Andie Thomas and Jeremy Alvarez knew it was
            their time to shine, you could hear Bethany Powell curse under her breath. With physics broken, it was like
            the wild west. But the racers knew this was for all the “marbles.” Josephine threw lettuce at Ruben. Kian
            came out brandishing a cleaver. Stefan stole 3 identities mid race. It was a mess (it looked a little like
            this.) But amidst the turmoil, 3 racers emerged victorious for the stage.</p>
        <p class="intro">
            Our top three finishers for stage 5 were 1.Andie Thomas, 2.Genevieve Henderson, and 3.Robyn Parker.</p>
        <p class="intro">
            Our final first-place finish for the 2020 Marble Madness Competition goes to Franklin Mason (Team Lee
            Banse.) He would like to thank his sponsors Lee Banse, Pablo Escobar (for single-handedly importing all the
            hippos in Colombia), and Heinz. He plans to celebrate by rubbing it in Kian James’ face while live-streaming
            it to his base of 47,000 fans.</p>
        <p class="intro">
            Second place goes to Rory Walsh (Team Heather Mahendran.) Rory would like to thank her sponsor, Heather, and
            would also like to yell at Halliburton for pulling their sponsorship of her after Stage 3. When approached
            for comment Halliburton stated that Rory was too volatile for “even them.” Rory’s celebration will be later
            tonight when she lights fireworks in an enclosed trailer and “lets it play out.”</p>
        <p class="intro">
            Our biggest surprise of this competition was perhaps our last-place finisher, Aubry Reynolds (Team Tim
            Grose.) He planned, he executed, and he lost terribly. Handing Aubry the last place trophy was kind of like
            pinning a participation medal on someone's chest, but involving a grown man… while crying.</p>
