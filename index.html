        <p class="intro_big"> Stage 3 is complete!</p>
        <p class="intro">
            Your marbles just finished a quick and dirty Stage 3. I would like to remind you that this stage had a
            disadvantage for marble weight. The quick turns and numerous obstacles of this stage made lighter marble
            seem to perform better. But again, gravity is a formidable adversary.</p>
        <p class="intro"> After a fairly mediocre performance on the first two stages, Built-like-a-plank Barbs Rogers
            walked away with the number 1 spot for stage 3. She would like to thank her sponsors: The Bird/Hillmans,
            Artemis: The moon goddess, and Tate's Cookies. In a post race interview, Barbs “invoked the fifth amendment”
            47 times.</p>
        <p class="intro">
            Rory Walsh finished second for the day. He had a particularly heated match up with Barbs and finished only
            .289 seconds behind. She attributes today's performance to her beanstalk like build and her team's
            data-driven approach. The matchup has #PlankvsBeanstalk trending on Twitter.</p>
        <p class="intro">
            Daniel Stewart finished up strongly in the last place spot for today. We listened in on the mid race
            commentary and Daniel seemed much more concerned with “these damn kids and their skateboards and their
            SnapTok...” than the race.</p>
        <!-- stage 4 -->
        <!-- <p class="intro">
                Your marbles just finished a quick and dirty Stage 4. This stage had a disadvantage for marble deformity. The bumpiness of this stage made it a nightmare for deformed marbles. But again, gravity likes to play by its own rules.</p>
            <p class="intro"> Daniel Stewart dashed across the finish line in 1st place this round only 1.337 seconds ahead of second place finisher, Barbs Rodgers. His last place finish yesterday was galvanizing. In his post race interview he quoted his hero, Kanye West, stating that “I done played the underdog my whole career but I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year?” Later Kanye retweeted it, saying that he “would let him finish... but Edie Green had one of the greatest races of all time.”</p>
            <p class="intro">
                Barbs Rodgers finished second for the day. After her first place finish yesterday, she brought the heat again today. But it doesn’t seem Barbs is resting on her laurels though. After her strong finish, she treated reporters to a spiritual interpretive dance symbolizing her continued faith in her performance. We think this may have been a PR stunt to keep her from speaking on camera.</p>
