        <p class="intro_big"> Stage 2 is complete!</p>

        <p class="intro">
            Our intrepid marbles just finished a grueling Stage 2. I would like to remind you that this stage had a
            priority on marble weight. Weight modifiers were given advantage but it didn’t always trump good ol’
            fashion, homemade, red-blooded, crocs-in-socks gravity.</p>

        <p class="intro"> Our number one spot of the day goes to Garrard Clarke. Finishing a full 4 seconds ahead of
            second-place
            Stefan Blaese, Garrard would like to thank his sponsors: Rick David, ACME, and Chiquita Bananas. In a
            post-race interview, Garrard refused to answer questions per the advice of his publicist. Rather, he just
            held up a 1996 Panasonic RX-5150 boombox playing Vangelis’ Chariots of Fire. We feel that was a sufficient
            answer to any question.</p>
        <p class="intro">
            Stefan Blaese appeared unphased by his showdown at the finish with Garrard. When asked about how he would
            adapt his tactics for tomorrow he responded by attempting to hawk his new energy drink “Blaese-Speed” citing
            that 4 in 5 veterinarians do not recommend it for human consumption. So, you know it’s legit.</p>
        <p class="intro">
            Billy Griffiths finished 3rd for the day but didn’t appear shaken. At her press conference, she stated that
            while she suspects some of the marbles of doping, but it won’t matter when she smashes them on the track.
            Update: Billy is also under investigation for performance-enhancing substances.</p>
        <p class="intro">
            Robyn Parker finished in a solid last place this stage, a little over a minute behind our first-place
            finish. He cited his race performance on unequal weight distribution and his team’s mid-strategy. When
            his
            team manager was approached for a comment, he said: “Wait, we’re supposed to have a strategy?”
