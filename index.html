        <p class="intro_big"> Stage 1 is complete!</p>

        <p class="intro">
            Stage one is complete folks! While <b>Chase Marshall</b> took a commanding lead, he was tripped up by some
            minor
            inconsistencies in his marble’s surface and finished 6th.<b> Kay, Starrie, and Franklin</b> traded places
            right up
            until the finish with Kay taking second (a separation of only .116 seconds I might add!) But our winner
            for the day is, of course, <b>Bethany Powell</b>. Bethany would like to thank her sponsor, Nina Houghton.
            Later, she added that she would be celebrating at a nearby Chuck E. Cheeses with some of her friends from
            space camp. We think this is a bold move the night before stage 2 but support her in her win.
        </p>
        <p class="intro"> Perhaps the most notable performance of the day was <b>Jeremy Alvarez</b> (deformity: 9.414)
            finishing in
            11th for
            the stage. In a post-race interview, we asked Jeremy how he pulled off such an incredible feat with his
            janky marble to which he responded “Hopes and dreams, player. Hopes and dreams.”
            Remember, there is a prize for first, second, and last place.<b> Stuart Cooper</b>, unfortunately, seemed to
            run
            into some mechanical trouble during the final stages of the race and finished in last place but he feels
            good and is hopeful for tomorrow’s race.
