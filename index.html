        <p class="intro"> As we all know, sports are canceled for the forseeable future. So why not keep the spirit of
            competition alive with good-old-fashion gravity. That's right. You heard me. Balls. Balls and Inclines.
            Let's
            get weird.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">Ok, here's how it works. I have 32 digital marbles, each of them with a unique color,
            personality,
            voter history, favorite sushi, and other things that make them hella different. Over the next 4 days, I will
            virtually race them all together in stages using a simulated particle physics algorhythm projected through
            weird 3d
            shapes that I come up with because the 'rona be REAL and I've got time. The order in which the marbles
            finish get assigned a point value going from 32 to 1 and they race over 5 stages.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">I know what your thinking... Isn't this basically flipping a coin to see which magic ball of
            glass
            gets the trophy? No dice, muchacho. Each "marble" is given a random weight between 2 and 5 grams as well as
            randomized spatial deformities (rated on scale of 1-10, 1= little deformity 10= dude, they've seen some
            shit)
            which make it behave uniquely when fed into the magic physics machine (it's just
            the unity engine without any graphics, what did you expect? I'm not made of money). but that means that
            truly
            some marbles will be better suited than others for racing. To compound that, the stages will give advantage
            or disadvantage to marbles depending on their attributes. Think: DnD meets marble racing (weight is like a
            dex modifier and deformity is like have a low acrobatics). Now your job is to guess based on weight and
            deformity what the magic math machine will deem worthy of the winning. Or just pick based on their
            names
            like a schmuck, who gives a shit. I mean, I'm the one doing the math here, you're job is easy.
