    <p class="intro"> These stages only exsist as numbers and forces applied to your "marbles." Just use your
        imagination and get back to what's really important... like rewatching Westworld because like seriously... it's
        been two years.

    <div class="banner_card">
        <h2 class="steptitle">1</h2>
        <p class="stepcopy">A good, old-fashion incline phase with very few obsticles. This stage seems to be pretty
            even and doesn't add or take away from your marbles modifiers.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="banner_card">
        <h2 class="steptitle">2</h2>
        <p class="stepcopy">A long straight away. Because of its incline, it seems to favor heavier marbles.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="banner_card">
        <h2 class="steptitle">3</h2>
        <p class="stepcopy"> A curvy long course with many obsticles. Lighter marbles seem to track (marginally) better
            on this simulation.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="banner_card">
        <h2 class="steptitle">4</h2>
        <p class="stepcopy">A long bumpy course. I'll be honest, this is hell on wheels for deformed marbles. Weight
            doesn't seem to affect performance that much.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="banner_card">
        <h2 class="steptitle">5</h2>
        <p class="stepcopy">Because computers are dope, this stage decided to throw physics the hell out. Deformed
            marbles
            perform almost 3 times better in this stage because let's face it, it would suck to be an ugly marble.
        </p>

    <p class="intro"> if you're into it, the math of each stage is accessable on the <a class="intextlink"

            Modifier spreadsheet</a>. Remember: a
        large part of this game is chance, so even if you pick the marble with the best change... gravity might still
        throw you a curveball.
